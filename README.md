# EasyAM The Next Generation
This is the current in-progress version of the EasyAM compiler.
There was a previous compiler. It works fine but by developing the software I have learned a lot about how I want the compiler to work that I didn't know when I started.

Wiki](https://wiki.info-ops.org/index.php/EasyAM).
